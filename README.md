# ProblemSet5
I missed week 6 which kind of threw me off the wagon. And I've been busy with performances, so finding time for tutoring hasn't been working out. So I appreciated the extra week on ProblemSet5. I was able to spend a whole day figuring out a lot of the functions I wasn't fully understanding. I researched struct on my own, so I'm not sure if my syntax is correct on 5.4, but it seems to work fine.


5.3 was by far the hardest. Allocating an obscure file type into specific array positions was a tough concept to grasp. After some homework sessions with Aaron I was able to get a better hold of it.
